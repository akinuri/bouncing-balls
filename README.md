# Bouncing Balls

Experiments about bouncing/colliding balls in 1D & 2D.

**Collisions in 1D**

* Problems solved
  * Ball-to-wall collision detection/handling
  * Ball-to-wall intersection (snapping)
  * Ball-to-ball collision detection/handling (1d elastic collision)
  * Ball-to-ball intersection (snapping)
  * Random distribution of balls in a container
* Problems to solve
  * Collision prediction/handling to prevent intersection when v > r

**Collisions in 2D (WIP)**
